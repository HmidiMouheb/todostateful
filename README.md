## ðŸŽˆTHEORYðŸŽˆ

### Three Principles

- [ ] Single source of truth
- [ ] State is read-only
- [ ] Changes are made with pure functions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ41D6LDSBg)

### Redux Constraints

- [ ] Single State Tree (the State is an Object)
- [ ] Actions Describe Updates (Actions are Objects)
- [ ] Reducers Apply Updates (Reducers are Functions)
- [ ] Explain Data Flow (Compare redux to neurotransmission)

## ðŸ‘¾Demo (Live Coding)ðŸ‘¾

### ðŸ‘¾ Redux Wa7dou Sec

- [ ] Installing redux & react-redux
- [ ] Creating a Store
- [ ] Dispatching an Action
- [ ] Updating the store using a Reducer

### ðŸ‘¾ Redux in React (Case Study: a Store with User & Products )

- [ ] Combining multiple reducers
- [ ] Setting an initial state for the store (Prepopulating data)
- [ ] Store enhancers (Redux DevTools ðŸ“¥ https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)
- [ ] Redux File structure & organisation (reducers & actions)
- [ ] Provider (making the store available for components)
- [ ] Connecting components to the Store
- [ ] mapStateToProps
- [ ] mapActionsToProps / mapDispatchToProps

### Bonus Tip: Debugging Workflow

- [ ] Log actions and states
- [ ] find the bad state
- [ ] check the action
- [ ] fix the reducer
- [ ] write a test (Don't worry about this one for now!)
